About the project:
In this computer networking project, suppose there is team called "Team Rainbow" which is an elite international counter-terrorism unit comprised of operatives from counter-terrorism organizations from all around the world. To provide training for new recruits and to provide training exercises to existing members Team Rainbow aims to setup six bases of operation which are code-named: Eagle Watch, Rogue Spear, Raven Shield, Black Arrow, Vegas and lastly Shadow Vanguard. These bases will be addressed as Bases or Branches. Among these branches there will be two field offices in Eagle Watch and Rogue Spear base which will be situated in the premise of the respective base and also the field offices will be in the same network of the respective base. The bases have to be connected with each other to share training progress, mission progress, mission report, recruitment report etc. You are hired by Team Rainbowâ€™s director Dr. Harry Pandey to design and implement a network to establish communication between all the bases/branches according to his requirements. In the following table the distance is given in kilometer between each of the bases/branches and the number of devices operated at each base/branch are mentioned in brackets beside the name of each base/branch.
